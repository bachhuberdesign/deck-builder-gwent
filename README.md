# Deck Builder for Gwent

A deckbuilding Android app for [GWENT®: The Witcher Card Game](https://www.playgwent.com/en) written in Kotlin. This project began as a way for me to test a few features of Kotlin and libraries that I was not using for work, but has expanded into a (soon to be) fully featured Gwent companion app. 

## Features
+ Fully featured deckbuilding UI
+ Card database
+ Stat/win tracking
+ Fully offline
+ More to come!
