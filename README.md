An Android deckbuilding  app for [GWENT®: The Witcher Card Game](https://www.playgwent.com/en) written in Kotlin. This project began as a way for me to test a few features of Kotlin and libraries that I was not using for work, but has expanded into a fully featured Gwent companion app. Please note, At this time, it is still **very much a work in-progress** and some core features are either 1. not implemented or 2. still need a lot of polish/bug fixes/testing before they are finished.

## Features
+ Fully featured deckbuilding UI
+ Card database
+ Stat/win tracking
+ Fully offline
+ More to come!
